(** Putnam 2025 B1 (axiom-free formulation).
    If every point in the plane is colored red or green, and for every
    three noncollinear same-color points the circumcenter also has that
    color, then all points are the same color.

    This version replaces the Parameter/Axiom circumcenter with a
    concrete Cramer's-rule construction. *)

       color A = color C ->
